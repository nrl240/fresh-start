# **Install iTerm2**

- iTerm is a terminal program that serves as a good alternative to OS X's built-in Terminal app. It has a number of improvements over Terminal, including:
    - Session restoration
    - Command+click to open hyperlinks
    - Highlighted search results (and regex in search)
    - More accurate color support
    - Better split plane control (e.g. vertical panes)
    - More versatile window options
    - More configurable hotkeys
    - Longer history
    - Support for system services and notifications
    - Frequent, ongoing development
- iTerm is free and has no obvious disadvantages compared to Terminal. On the other hand, none of its features are necessary â€” just nice.
